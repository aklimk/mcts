# mcts

A Monte-Carlo Tree Search implementation written in rust. Includes a chess example environment.

# Building/Running

Building and running the project is managed by the rust cargo project manager. Simply use `cargo build`
to build the project and `cargo run` to run the project.

Currently the only feature of the chess environment is integration tests that compute the solution to 
a few hand selected chess puzzles.
